# DRDS Overview

Our team of 7.5 developers and 1 manager works primarily remotely.

## Communication within our team

* [Slack](https://pulibrary.slack.com/) for quick chats, group discussions, sharing news, asking for feedback/code review, etc.
  * It's good to be generally available on Slack, but it's fine to mute/ignore/turn off as needed
* [Github](https://github.com/pulibrary) PRs/issues for code review, remembering things for later, recording feedback
* Zoom to have discussions, daily check-ins, work cycle kickoff/wrapup, backlog grooming
  * If you use outlook, there’s a zoom plugin for outlook which will allow you to add a zoom meeting during scheduling
* [Outlook/Exchange email/calendars](https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox) calendars for internal meetings — please share your calendar with the rest of the team to make it easier to book meetings

## Scheduled Meetings

* Monday Planning meeting (up to 1 hr):
  * The running agenda is available in the [ITIMS - Checkins folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KRp9AavImqMu-cslyPHPbaKNoR-eLXB8).
  * This meeting is guided by a running agenda populated with specific GitHub issues based on the previous week's triaging, inbox triaging performed by individuals, or other specific questions. All tickets are discussed in the order in which they are added to the agenda. Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Tuesday - Thursday Check-in meetings (15 minutes):
  * The running agenda is available in the [ITIMS - Checkins folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KRp9AavImqMu-cslyPHPbaKNoR-eLXB8).
  * These are daily check-ins to tell if someone is [blocked](https://www.solutioneers.co.uk/blockers/) in their work.  There is a brief round robin at the top, where each team member shares the GitHub ID number and title of issue they're working on, and specifies whether or not they are blocked.  If a team member is working on something that does not / does not yet have a GitHub issue associated with it, they describe very briefly (as in, the length of an issue title) what they are working on, and whether or not they are blocked.  If someone reports being blocked, their item for follow-up goes onto the top of the check-ins' running agenda for discussion after the round robin.  Leftover items on the agenda at the end of the meeting are carried to the next one as appropriate.
  * Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Friday Wrap-up meeting (1 hr):
  * The running agenda is available in the [ITIMS - Checkins folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KRp9AavImqMu-cslyPHPbaKNoR-eLXB8).
  * The agenda/notes for this meeting are posted every Friday to the #devs Slack channel as a reminder.
  * This meeting has an agenda with two objectives: an agenda-driven meeting, and a written section that attendees populate with bullet points as representative summaries of their work for the week that they wish to highlight in the meeting.  The written section is open for review and questions that can be added to the agenda, however it is not read aloud.
  * Anyone attending is welcome to add to the agenda that drives the meeting.  The meeting leads with agenda items from cross-team collaborators, and can also be built during the meeting.
  * After this, the DRDS team assigns a [runner](/runner.md) and distribute ourselves to projects for the next week.
  * Cross-team attendees are always welcome.
* Twice yearly team retrospectives (several hours):
  * Twice a year as part of our "All Hands" meetings we have time as a team to conduct a retrospective of our team process. This is an opportunity for everyone to share what is going well on our team and what's not working, and re-evaluate any process that we've put in place to deal with pain points to find out whether they're working. This is often a full afternoon, and sometimes results in follow-up meetings as well. We leave these meetings with specific changes to our process (often reflected in this handbook) to address the issues we discussed.

## Communication with other teams

* Email for getting input from outside IT, or for longer-form feedback
  * Our group email address: digital-library@princeton.libanswers.com
  * When issues come in for us from libanswers, everyone will get alerted. The first person to respond should click through to the issue and either deal with it, create an issue for it, or assign it to the appropriate person.
  * Note that clicking through to a ticket will automatically assign it to you. You can click the "unassign" button if needed. If you just want to browse tickets, you can use the eye icon on the list in the UI to "quick look," which won't assign it to you.
* SN@P / lsupport
  * Create an issue for helpdesk or operations by emailing lsupport@princeton.edu
* List-servs:
  * Library-Systems@princeton.edu - goes to all library systems: developers,
  * sysadmins, helpdesk, digitization studio
  * Lib-Prof-IT@princeton.edu - just developers, sysadmins, and managers
* [Digital Collections and
  Initiatives](https://library.princeton.edu/digital-collections/news) page of the library Website
